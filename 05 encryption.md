# 🔐 Encryption Techniques — 05

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand cryptography basics  
- Differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric encryption  
- Learn hashing and digital signature concepts  

---

## 🧩 Cryptography
Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications using codes to ensure confidentiality.

---

## 🔸 Symmetric Encryption
- Uses one key for both encryption and decryption.  
- Fast, suitable for bulk data encryption.  

---

## 🔹 Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses two keys: public key (for encryption) and private key (for decryption).  
- Used for secure key exchange and digital communication.  


- Converts data into a fixed-length string.  
- Used for secure data integrity verification.
- - Used for secure key exchange and digital communication.

## Hashing

Converts data into a fixed-length string.

One-way process - cannot be reversed.

Used for password storage and integrity

Common Algorithms: SHA-256, MD5 (deprecated)

## Digital Signatures and Certificates

Ensure authenticity and non-repudiation.

A digital signature uses private key to sign data and public key to verify.

Certificates (X.509) are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) for trust verification (used in HTTPS
## Example : 
When visiting https://bank.com
  - browser verifies  certificate signed by CA to ensure authenticity.
